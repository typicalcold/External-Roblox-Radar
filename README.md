# External radar!

**What is this?**
This is for people who want to have a small advantage, without a big risk of detection on your main account. This is dumb, i know.

**How does this work?**
2 players join the same game.
Theres 2 computers/devices (android emulators might work? but only maybe for client)
One computer does the hacky stuff then sends player positions to the next computer (only alt account has risk of ban by anticheat)
The computer on the main account, reads that data, and visualizes it!
Main account doesnt have any program reading or tampering with Roblox's memory!

Theres latency issues. but i cant really fix that!
