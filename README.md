**What is this?**

This is for people who want to have a small advantage, without a big risk of detection on your main account. This is dumb, i know.




**How does this work?**

2 players join the same game. 

Theres 2 computers/devices (android emulators might work? but only maybe for client) 

One computer does the hacky stuff then sends player positions to the next computer (only alt account has risk of ban by anticheat) 

The computer on the main account, reads that data, and visualizes it! (windows only)

Main account doesnt have any program reading or tampering with Roblox's memory! 

Theres latency issues. but i cant really fix that!

**Instructions**

MAKE SURE BOTH DEVICES ARE ON THE SAME WIFI NETWORK, DO NOT USE THIS IN A PUBLIC SPACE LIKE THE LIBRARY OR SCHOOL

download everything and unzip it all into a fold somewhere, on both devices , the downlaods folder would work.

ON ALT ACCOUNT PC copy everything in client.lua into your executor of choice (anything works as long as it has websocket support, this account is the one your fine with getting banned on)

ON MAIN ACCOUNT PC run the install_requried_files.bat

ON MAIN ACCOUNT PC run the GETLOCALIP.bat and copy the ip (make sure your not copying the spaces)

ON ALT ACCOUNT PC paste the IP into local_ip variable in the client pc executor (further steps are provided in the steps if needed)

ON ALT ACCOUNT PC set localPlayer to your main accounts username

ON MAIN ACCOUNT PC open python file as notepad and set local_player_name to your main roblox name and save the file
